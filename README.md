## Introduction

This project aims to provide a basic foundation for building a Telegram bot using the Telegraf library. Telegraf is a modern and powerful Node.js library for creating bots for Telegram. The project structure has been designed to maintain clean code organization, separation of concerns, and ease of maintenance.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the Telegram bot on your local machine.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/superXdev/telegram-bot-starter
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Copy `.env` file
```bash
cp env .env
```

4. Configure the database connection:

Edit the `src/config/config.js` file and provide the necessary database connection details. This file will handle the database migration and establish the connection with the models.

5. Run the database migration:

```bash
npm run migrate
```

6. Start the bot:

```bash
npm start
```

## Project Structure

### 1. `src/handler.js`

The `handler.js` file contains the main logic for handling incoming messages and commands from users. This is where you'll define the behavior of the bot based on different events, such as text messages, commands, and more.

### 2. `src/index.js`

The `index.js` file serves as the entry point of the application. It initializes the Telegraf bot and sets up the necessary configurations. You are advised not to modify this file unless necessary.

### 3. `src/controllers/`

The `controllers` folder contains all the logic for the Telegram bot. Each file in this folder corresponds to a specific functionality or feature of the bot. For example, you might have separate files for handling user authentication, data retrieval, or other operations.

### 4. `src/model/`

The `model` folder contains all the Sequelize models for interacting with the database. Each model represents a table in the database and encapsulates the data logic.

### 5. `src/migrations/`

The `migrations` folder contains all the files required for database migration. These files enable you to manage changes to the database schema in a version-controlled manner.

### 6. `src/views/`

The `views` folder contains JavaScript files responsible for displaying output or messages to users in the Telegram bot. Each file may represent a specific view or message format that the bot uses to communicate with users.

### 7. `src/config/config.js`

The `config.js` file is responsible for configuring Sequelize and establishing the database connection. It also handles the migration process to set up the database schema according to the defined models.
